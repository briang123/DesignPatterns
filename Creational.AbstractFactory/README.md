# Abstract Factory Pattern

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/abstract_factory_pattern.htm

Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

In Abstract Factory pattern an interface is responsible for creating a factory of related objects without explicitly specifying their classes. Each generated factory can give the objects as per the Factory pattern.

# Implementation
We are going to create a Shape interface and concrete classes implementing this interfaces. We create an abstract factory class AbstractFactory as the next step. Factory class ShapeFactory is defined where each factory extends AbstractFactory. A factory creator/generator class FactoryProducer is created.

Program, our demo class uses FactoryProducer to get a AbstractFactory object. It will pass information (RECTANGLE / SQUARE for Shape) to AbstractFactory to get the type of object it needs.
