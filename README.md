# C# Design Patterns

The definitions below for the Creational, Structural, and Behavioral Patterns come from:
https://www.dofactory.com/net/design-patterns

(P) - Pending Completion

## Creational Patterns

**Abstract Factory** - Creates an instance of several families of classes

**Builder** - Separates object construction from its representation

**Factory Method** - Creates an instance of several derived classes

**Prototype** - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

**Singleton** - A class of which only a single instance can exist

## Structural Patterns
**Adapter** (P) - Match interfaces of different classes

**Bridge** (P) - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation

**Composite** - A tree structure of simple and composite objects

**Decorator** (P) - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically

**Facade** - A single class that represents an entire subsystem

**Flyweight** (P) - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing

**Proxy** (P) - An object representing another object

## Behavioral Patterns
**Chain of Resp.** - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects

**Command** - Encapsulate a command request as an object

**Interpreter** - A way to include language elements in a program

**Iterator** - Sequentially access the elements of a collection

**Mediator** - Defines simplified communication between classes

**Memento** - Capture and restore an object's internal state

**Observer** - A way of notifying change to a number of classes

**State** - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes

**Strategy** - Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class

**Template Method** - Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass

**Visitor** - Defines a new operation to a class without change

## Bonus Patterns

**MVC** - Separation of concerns with a Model, View, Controller

**Publish-Subscribe** - Ability for objects to publish events and for other objects to subscribe to those event triggers
